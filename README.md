# serverless-fastify-starter

Starter repo for a TypeScript Node.js serverless service powered by Fastify and
DynamoDB. It includes the base for deploying the service to AWS using
Infrastructure as Code (IaC) with Pulumi. The service is deployed to AWS Lambda
and the API is exposed through AWS API Gateway.

Pretty basic setup so far. I crated this because I got tired of copying and
replacing the same code every time I started a new serverless API. Let's
see where it goes.
